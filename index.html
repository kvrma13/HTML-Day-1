		<h1>About the Man Himself</h1>


	
	<h2> My Intrest</h2>
	<p> There is alot to know about me. I'm a very quiet and observant person. I dont really know why I just am it just what works best for me. Im not really antisocial as some people would think i just have to get warmed up to the people as I try to read them. Im also not the typical thinker, I like to think out side the box and im also a visual learner. My brain works alot different than most it can be a good thing or a bad thing at times really it depends on what Im doing. I pay attention to the little things most people wouldnt with that it means some of the simple things people understand I look at very different thats where the visual learning comes in. I love sports, music, animals, fashion and cars like the typical 18 year old except i would like to create something that can bring all of that together some how. I love retro Jordans specifically Jordan 1's <img src="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Travis-Scott-x-Air-Jordan-1-Sail-Dark-Mocha-University-Red-Black-Release-Date-Pricing.jpg" /> <br>

		<p>My dream car would probably have to be a 2018 Buick Continental. I thinks its the closest thing to a Rolls Royce without spendeing the Rolls Royce money, it has way better gas mileage too which is a big deal in the city. 12 mpg in the city isnt the ideal way to travel luxury or not id take 18 mpg anyday. Its not slow either it comes with a v6 tein turbo that has up to 400hp and a top speed of 160 mph. </p> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0e/45/c3/0e45c395d2f782725072c1fb641e919a.jpg" />

	<h2>Things That Annoy Me </h2>
     <p> Honestly alot of things annoy me. Loud places or people when its not needed, attitude that isnt needed, pretty much any human impulse that people dont think about before doing. Im a very quiet self reserved person, I think that is a big reason why I am like this it can be used to my benifit sometimes. Small dogs are annoying to me also lol. i need "mans best friend" not a genetically modified rat on a stick. I also dont like snoopy people. People that snoop around to mch are federal adn spill personal informationn others were not suppsed to know or they </p> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS0FaXw7VncGsx_h-UU0SXjYjiRjqV8AmMYVNAVLspkBwwqKF4FhQ">

    <h2> My Goals in Life</h2>
    <p> I have alot of goals i would like to accomplish. First i would like to help my family out with whatever they need bills food the basic things we all need. Eventually i would like to open a few small businesses and use the money from them to help the homeless and less fortunate. I know how it feels to not have everything you want and need and for as many people on the earth there is it seems like only a few actually care. Me being the person i am and seeing the hurt in the people that walk by me everyday, i would like to make as much as a change on as many people as i can.</p>
